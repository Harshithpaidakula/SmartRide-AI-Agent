# smart-ride-ai-agent
Built with Next.js (frontend), Django(backend), OpenAI for NLU/explanations, and a deterministic engine for parallel ride bookings. This AI-driven platform finds the Low-cost rides across providers based on user priorities, explains choices, and safely falls back to deep links for a legal demo. Mocks used; real APIs supported.
